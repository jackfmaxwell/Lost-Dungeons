## The Game

Lost dungeons is a coop dungeon crawler RPG. I focus heavily on allowing the player to specialize their 'build' to suite their playstyle and to allow them to play a role in their team. Players work through dungeons that contain puzzles and encounters that push players to express their 'build' in their team.  

## Technicals

The game is steam integrated and uses the SteamP2P system to host games. Players can join and invite their friends using steam. 

## Next Steps

There is some final fixes to sort out with networking objects, and after that I will create a collection of items to balance as well as new levels that encourage player build specifiaction.
